# Unsupervised Learning

## Conceptual

### Question 1

> This problem involves the $K$-means clustering algorithm.
>
> a. Prove (12.18).

12.18 is:

$$
\frac{1}{|C_k|}\sum_{i,i' \in C_k} \sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - x_{i'j})^2 =
2 \sum_{i \in C_k} \sum_{j=1}^p  (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2
$$

where $$\bar{x}_{kj} = \frac{1}{|C_k|}\sum_{i \in C_k} x_{ij}$$

On the left hand side we compute the difference between each observation
(indexed by $i$ and $i'$). In the second we compute the difference between
each observation and the mean. Intuitively this identity is clear (the factor
of 2 is present because we calculate the difference between each pair twice).
However, to prove.

Note first that,
\begin{align}
(x_{ij} - x_{i'j})^2
  = & ((x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj}) - (x_{i'j} - \bar{x}_{kj}))^2 \\
  = & (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2 -
      2(x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})(x_{i'j} - \bar{x}_{kj}) +
      (x_{i'j} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2
\end{align}

Note that the first term is independent of $i'$ and the last is independent of
$i$.

Therefore, 10.12 can be written as:

\begin{align}
\frac{1}{|C_k|}\sum_{i,i' \in C_k} \sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - x_{i'j})^2
= & \frac{1}{|C_k|}\sum_{i,i' \in C_k}\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2 -
    \frac{1}{|C_k|}\sum_{i,i' \in C_k}\sum_{j=1}^p 2(x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})(x_{i'j} - \bar{x}_{kj}) +
    \frac{1}{|C_k|}\sum_{i,i' \in C_k}\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{i'j} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2 \\
= & \frac{|C_k|}{|C_k|}\sum_{i \in C_k}\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2 -
    \frac{2}{|C_k|}\sum_{i,i' \in C_k}\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})(x_{i'j} - \bar{x}_{kj}) +
    \frac{|C_k|}{|C_k|}\sum_{i \in C_k}\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2 \\
= & 2 \sum_{i \in C_k}\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})^2
\end{align}

Note that we can drop the term containing
$(x_{ij} - \bar{x}_{kj})(x_{i'j} - \bar{x}_{kj})$ since this is 0 when summed
over combinations of $i$ and $i'$ for a given $j$.

> b. On the basis of this identity, argue that the $K$-means clustering
>    algorithm (Algorithm 12.2) decreases the objective (12.17) at each
>    iteration.

Equation 10.12 demonstrates that the euclidean distance between each possible
pair of samples can be related to the difference from each sample to the mean
of the cluster. The K-means algorithm works by minimizing the euclidean distance
to each centroid, thus also minimizes the within-cluster variance.

```

  x2 = c(4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0)
)
ggplot(d, aes(x = x1, y = x2)) + geom_point()
```

centroids <- sapply(c(1,2), function(i) colMeans(d[d$cluster == i, 1:2]))
```

```{r}
dist <- sapply(1:2, function(i) {

})
d$cluster <- apply(dist, 1, which.min)
```

> e. Repeat (c) and (d) until the answers obtained stop changing.

```{r}
centroids <- sapply(c(1,2), function(i) colMeans(d[d$cluster == i, 1:2]))
dist <- sapply(1:2, function(i) {
    sqrt((d$x1 - centroids[1, i])^2 + (d$x2 - centroids[2, i])^2)
})
d$cluster <- apply(dist, 1, which.min)
```

In this case, we get stable labels after the first iteration.

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x = x1, y = x2, color = factor(cluster))) + geom_point()
```

### Question 4

>
> a. At a certain point on the single linkage dendrogram, the clusters {1, 2, 3}

The complete linkage fusion will likely be higher in the tree since single
linkage is defined as being the minimum distance between two clusters. However,
there is a chance that they could be at the same height (so technically there
is not enough information to tell).

> b. At a certain point on the single linkage dendrogram, the clusters {5} and

They will fuse at the same height (the algorithm for calculating distance is
the same when the clusters are of size 1).

### Question 5

In cases where variables are scaled we would expect clusters to correspond
to whether or not the retainer sold a computer. In the first case (raw numbers
of items sold), we would expect clusters to represent low vs high numbers of 
sock purchases.

To test, we can run the analysis in R:

```{r}
set.seed(42)
dat <- data.frame(
  socks = c(8, 11, 7, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8),
  computers = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
)
kmeans(dat, 2)$cluster
kmeans(scale(dat), 2)$cluster
dat$computers <- dat$computers * 2000
kmeans(dat, 2)$cluster
```

```{r}
dat <- t(scale(t(USArrests)))
d1 <- dist(dat)^2
d2 <- as.dist(1 - cor(t(dat)))
plot(d1, d2)
```

### Question 8

colSums(pr$x^2) / sum(colSums(scale(USArrests)^2))
```

### Question 9

```{r}
ct <- cutree(hc, 3)
sapply(1:3, function(i) names(ct)[ct == i])
```

Scaling results in different clusters and the choice of whether to scale or 
not depends on the data in question. In this case, the variables are:

  - Murder    numeric  Murder arrests (per 100,000)  
  - Assault   numeric  Assault arrests (per 100,000) 
  - UrbanPop  numeric  Percent urban population      
  - Rape      numeric  Rape arrests (per 100,000)    

These variables are not naturally on the same unit and the units involved are
somewhat arbitrary (so for example, Murder could be measured per 1 million 
rather than per 100,000) so in this case I would argue the data should be 
scaled.

data[classes == "B", 1:10] <- data[classes == "B", 1:10] + 1.2
data[classes == "C", 5:30] <- data[classes == "C", 5:30] + 1

```{r}

$K$-means separates out the clusters nearly perfectly.

> d.  Perform $K$-means clustering with $K = 2$. Describe your results.

```{r}
km <- kmeans(data, 2)$cluster

$K$-means effectively defines cluster 2 to be class B, but cluster 1 is a mix
of classes A and B. 

> e.  Now perform $K$-means clustering with $K = 4$, and describe your results.

```{r}
km <- kmeans(data, 4)$cluster
table(km, names(km))
```

$K$-means effectively defines cluster 1 to be class B, cluster 2 to be class A
but clusters 3 and 4 are split over class C.

```{r}

$K$-means again separates out the clusters nearly perfectly.

$K$-means appears to perform less well on the scaled data in this case.

### Question 13

> On the book website, `www.StatLearning.com`, there is a gene expression data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/Ch12Ex13.csv", header = FALSE)
colnames(data) <- c(paste0("H", 1:20), paste0("D", 1:20))
```

> b. Apply hierarchical clustering to the samples using correlation-based
>    distance, and plot the dendrogram. Do the genes separate the samples into

```{r}
hc.complete <- hclust(as.dist(1 - cor(data)), method = "complete")
plot(hc.complete)

hc.complete <- hclust(as.dist(1 - cor(data)), method = "average")
plot(hc.complete)

hc.complete <- hclust(as.dist(1 - cor(data)), method = "single")
plot(hc.complete)
```

Yes the samples clearly separate into the two groups, although the results 
depend somewhat on the linkage method used. In the case of average clustering,
the disease samples all fall within a subset of the healthy samples.

> c. Your collaborator wants to know which genes differ the most across the two

This is probably best achieved with a supervised approach. A simple method
would be to determine which genes show the most significant differences between
the groups by applying a t-test to each group. We can then select those with a
FDR adjusted p-value less than some given threshold (e.g. 0.05).

```{r}
class <- factor(rep(c("Healthy", "Diseased"), each = 20))
pvals <- p.adjust(apply(data, 1, function(v) t.test(v ~ class)$p.value))
which(pvals < 0.05)
```
